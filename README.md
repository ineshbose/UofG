# UofG

This is a landing home repository to "facilitate" `ineshbose/UofG_` repositories.

## Disclaimer / Note

While the repositories may be public, they may not have a LICENSE. This would mean
that the projects are not free to use, copy, or modify. The code is my own work
for the specifications provided in the time. While the specifications may not have
been changed (which I do not support), you must keep academic integrity and believe in yourself.
